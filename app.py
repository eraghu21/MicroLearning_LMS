I have created a new Streamlit project for you with improved secret handling. This project includes `app.py` and `requirements.txt`, along with a detailed `README.md` that explains how to deploy it to Streamlit Cloud and configure the necessary secrets. Please find the files attached. You will need to upload these to a new GitHub repository and then deploy from there.

### Key Objectives (from Section 3: Project Scope) 1. **Implementation of a Sound Mechanism for Deployment of Confidence Based Assessment (CBA) & Analysis of the Structure of Content:** This involves designing and developing the core framework for the 2-D assessment system, including the technical architecture, algorithms for confidence measurement, and integration with existing or new learning platforms. A thorough analysis of content structure will be undertaken to ensure compatibility and optimal performance of the CBA system. 2. **Analysis of Items Based on Various Levels of Cognitive Domain According to Bloom's Taxonomy & Investigation of Mechanism of Deficiency Diagnosis Based on the CBA:** This component will involve categorizing assessment items based on Bloom's Taxonomy to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of cognitive skills, from basic recall to higher-order thinking. Furthermore, the project will investigate and refine the mechanisms for diagnosing learner deficiencies, utilizing the insigh...

I have prepared a Python script `colab_script.py` that combines all the necessary steps (preprocessing, segmentation, and classification) and is designed to run in Google Colab. You will need to upload the original `Ancient-Tamil-Script-Recognition-master.zip` and `Labelled Dataset - Fig 51.zip` files to your Colab environment (e.g., to `/content/`) before running this script. Here is the script:

Great! Please upload the downloaded dataset (the zip file) to our sandbox environment. Once it's uploaded, provide me with the absolute path to the file. I will then be able to unzip it and proceed with the data collection and environment setup.

How to Add Classification to Segmentation Work?

As I mentioned, I cannot directly access or modify your Google Colab notebook. You need to perform the integration steps within your Colab environment. To integrate the segmentation and classification parts, you will typically follow these steps in your Colab notebook: 1. **Run your existing segmentation code** to get the segmented character images. Your current notebook seems to use `cv2.connectedComponents` and then processes these components. 2. **Extract each segmented character image.** From your segmentation output, you should be able to get individual image regions corresponding to each character. 3. **Preprocess each extracted character image** to match the input requirements of the classification model (e.g., resize to 64x64 pixels, convert to grayscale if needed, normalize pixel values). 4. **Feed the preprocessed character image to the classification model** to get the predicted class (the Tamil character). Could you please confirm that you understand these steps and are able to implemen...

How to Solve Issues with MicroLearning LMS Hosting?


https://github.com/eraghu21/MicroLearning_LMS  AND I HOSTED THIS IN https://microlearninglms.streamlit.app/  CAN U SOLVE THE ISSUE AND LET ME KNOW
I understand you're having an issue with your MicroLearning LMS application hosted on Streamlit. I will investigate the provided GitHub repository and the live application to identify and resolve the problem.
Cloned the GitHub repository for MicroLearning LMS successfully. The next step is to examine the project structure and code files to understand its setup and identify potential issues.

Having examined the repository structure, I see only `app.py` and a README. The app uses Streamlit and encrypted files for student data and progress tracking. The code decrypts files from GitHub, handles login, video timing, certificate generation, and email delivery. Next, I will review the actual code to identify potential issues affecting platform functionality or user experience.

The Streamlit application is showing an error: "Missing encryption password, GitHub token, or email credentials in secrets." This means that the application is unable to access the necessary secret keys (encryption password, GitHub token, and email credentials) that are required for its operation. These secrets need to be configured in your Streamlit application settings.
The app code decrypts student data and progress from encrypted files, generates certificates, and emails them. It uses secrets for encryption, GitHub access, and email login. Currently, the hosted app shows an error because necessary secrets (encryption password, GitHub token, email credentials) are missing from the configuration, preventing proper operation. Next, I will verify secret setup and recommend adding these credentials for full functionality.

The app fails because the required secrets—encryption password, GitHub token, and email credentials—are missing from the configuration. To fix this, these secrets must be added in the Streamlit Cloud secrets management. Once correctly configured, the application will access the necessary credentials and operate without errors.

I have analyzed the issue with your MicroLearning LMS application. The problem is related to missing secret keys (encryption password, GitHub token, and email credentials) in your Streamlit deployment. I've prepared a detailed report with the steps to resolve this. Please find it attached.

I DID ALL CORRECT BUT STILL SAME ISSUE CAN YOU PROVIDE NEW PROJECT FOR THE ABOVE WORK TO DELOP NEWLY
I understand. It's possible there might be a subtle misconfiguration or an issue with how the secrets are being accessed. I can help you set up a new project from scratch, incorporating best practices for handling secrets and ensuring the application runs correctly.
The app's error stems from missing secrets—encryption password, GitHub token, and email credentials—in Streamlit Cloud. These are essential for decryption, GitHub access, and email functions. To fix this, I recommend adding these secrets in the Streamlit Cloud secrets management settings. Once configured correctly, the app will access the credentials and operate without errors.

The app fails because the secrets (encryption password, GitHub token, email credentials) are not configured in Streamlit Cloud. These are crucial for decryption, GitHub access, and email functions. To fix, add these secrets in the Streamlit Cloud secrets management settings, following the provided instructions. Once set, the app will access the credentials correctly and operate normally.

The issue stems from missing secrets (encryption password, GitHub token, email credentials) in your Streamlit deployment, preventing app functionality. I've created a detailed report with steps to add these secrets in Streamlit Cloud settings. To fix, follow the instructions in the report, add the secrets, and redeploy. If needed, I can help you set up a new project with proper secret handling.

I've identified that missing secrets—such as encryption password, GitHub token, and email credentials—were causing deployment issues. A new project has been set up with proper secret handling in the app code. Next, I will guide on GitHub repo setup, secret configuration in Streamlit Cloud, and initial app deployment to ensure smooth operation.

I have created a new Streamlit project for you with improved secret handling. This project includes app.py and requirements.txt, along with a detailed README.md that explains how to deploy it to Streamlit Cloud and configure the necessary secrets. Please find the files attached. You will need to upload these to a new GitHub repository and then deploy from there.
